### Overview
* Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. This particular dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition.

* My task is to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. After answering each question, I wrote a brief explanation of my results in a markdown cell of my Jupyter notebook.
* This project requires plots that communicate my results.
